## Overview
Registers are a fundamental building block of digital hardware, and the IO core provides a simple way of interacting with them from the host machine. It allows you to define a set of inputs and outputs of arbitrary width, and then set values to the outputs and read values from the inputs.

This is a very, very simple task - and while configuration is straightforward, there are a few caveats. More on both topics below:

## Configuration

Just like the rest of the cores, the IO core is configured via an entry in a project's configuration file. This is easiest to show by example:

```yaml
---
the_muppets:
  type: io

  inputs:
    kermit: 3
    piggy: 1
    animal: 38
    scooter: 4

  outputs:
    fozzy: 1
    gonzo: 3
```
This configuration specifies four parameters:

- `name`: The name of the IO core. This name is used to reference the core when working with the API, and can be whatever you'd like.
- `type`: This denotes that this is an IO core. All cores contain a `type` field, which must be set to `io` to be recognized as an IO core.
- `inputs`: This lists all inputs from from the FPGA fabric to the host machine. Signals in this list may be read by the host, but ___cannot___ be written to.
- `outputs`: This lists all outputs from the host machine to the FPGA fabric. Signals in this list may be written by the host, but ___can___ also be read from, and doing so returns the value last written to the register.

Lastly, the name of the core and the names of the probes are referenced in the autogenerated Verilog. This means that while the names can be arbitrary, they must be unique within your project and not contain any characters that your synthesis engine won't appreciate. As an example, here's an instance of what the autogenerated module would look like for the configuration above:

```verilog
manta manta_inst (
    .clk(clk),

    .rx(rx),
    .tx(tx),

    .kermit(kermit),
    .piggy(piggy),
    .animal(animal),
    .scooter(scooter),
    .fozzy(fozzy),
    .gonzo(gonzo));
```


## Python API

The IO core functionality is stored in the `Manta.IOCore` and `Manta.IOCoreProbe` classes in [src/manta/io_core/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/fischermoseley/manta/blob/main/src/manta/io_core/__init__.py), and it may be controlled with the two functions:

`Manta.IOCoreProbe.set(int, bool data)`

- [`int`, `bool`] _data_: The value to write to an output probe. May be signed or unsigned, but will raise an exception if the value is too large for the width of the port.
- _returns_: None

This method is blocking. When called it will dispatch a request to the FPGA, and wait until a response has been receieved.

---

`Manta.IOCoreProbe.set()`

- _returns_: The value of an input or output probe. In the case of an output probe, the value returned will be the last value written to the probe.

This method is blocking. When called it will dispatch a request to the FPGA, and wait until a response has been receieved.

### Example

A small example is shown below, using the [example configuration](#configuration) above. More extensive examples can also be found in the repository's [examples/](https://github.com/fischermoseley/manta/tree/main/examples) folder.

```python
>>> import Manta
>>> m = Manta
>>> m.my_io_core.fozzy.set(True)
>>> m.my_io_core.fozzy.get()
True
>>> m.my_io_core.gonzo.set(4)
>>> m.my_io_core.scooter.get()
5
```

## Caveats

While the IO core performs a very, very simple task, it carries a few caveats.

- First, __it's not instantaneous__. Manta has designed to be as fast as possible, but setting and querying registers relies on passing messages between the host and FPGA, which is slow relative to FPGA clock speeds! If you're trying to set values in your design with cycle-accurate timing, this will not do that for you. However, the [Logic Analyzer's playback feature](./logic_analyzer.md#playback) might be helpful.

- Second, __the API methods are blocking__, and will wait for a response from the FPGA before resuming program execution. Depending on your application, you might want to run your IO Core operations in a seperate thread, but you can also decrease the execution time by using a faster interface between the host and FPGA. This means using a higher UART baudrate, or using Ethernet.

## How It Works

This is done with the architecture shown below:

<img src="/assets/io_core_block_diagram.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Each of the probes is mapped to a register of Manta's internal memory. Since Manta's internal registers are 16 bits wide, probes less than 16 bits are mapped to a single register, but probes wider than 16 bits require multiple.

Whatever the number of registers required, these are read from and written to by the host machine - but the connection to the user's logic isn't direct. The value of each probe is buffered, and only once the `strobe` register has been set to one will the buffers update. When this happens, output probes provide new values to user logic, and new values for input probes are read from user logic. This provides a convenient place to perform clock domain crossing, and also mitigates the possibility of an inconsistent system state. More details on this can be found in Chapter 3.6 of the [original thesis](thesis.pdf).
