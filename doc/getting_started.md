## Getting Started
Manta is installed with `pip3 install mantaray`. Or at least it will be, once it's out of alpha. For now, it's installable with `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ mantaray`, which just pulls from the PyPI testing registry.

## Examples
Examples can be found under `examples/`. These target the Xilinx Series 7 FPGAs on the [Nexys A7](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/start)/[Nexys4 DDR](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/start) and the Lattice iCE40 on the [Icestick](https://www.latticesemi.com/icestick).
